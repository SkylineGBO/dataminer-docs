# Aggregated parameter descriptions

- **Number Market**: Calculated. The total number of associated Markets. Calculated via aggregation.

- **Number Hub**: Calculated. The total number of associated Hubs. Calculated via aggregation.

- **Number CCAP Core**: Calculated. The total number of associated CCAP Cores. Calculated via aggregation.

- **Number Service Group**: Calculated. The total number of associated Service Groups. Calculated via aggregation.

- **Number CM**: Calculated. The total number of associated CMs. Calculated via aggregation.

- **Number CM Offline**: Calculated. The total number of associated CMs that do not have Operational status.

  Calculated by aggregating the number of CMs reported as offline by the CCAP (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.4491.2.1.20.1.3.1.6) (1 Other = Offline, 8 Operational = Online, any other value = Initializing).

- **Percentage CM Offline**: Calculated. The percentage of assicated offline CMs, from the CCAP perspective.

  Calculated based on the CMs reported as offline by the CCAP (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.4491.2.1.20.1.3.1.6) (1 Other = Offline, 8 Operational = Online, any other value = Initializing).

- **Number CM DOCSIS 2.0**: Calculated. The total number of assocaited cable modems that report their DOCSIS version as a version within the 2.0 range.

- **Number CM DOCSIS 3.0**: Calculated. The total number of assocaited cable modems that report their DOCSIS version as a version within the 3.0 range.

- **Number CM DOCSIS 3.1**: Calculated. The total number of assocaited cable modems that report their DOCSIS version as a version within the 3.1 range.

- **Number CM DOCSIS 1.x**: Calculated. The total number of assocaited cable modems that report their DOCSIS version as a version within the 1.x range.

- **Number CM DOCSIS Other**: Calculated. The total number of assocaited cable modems that are unable to report their DOCSIS version or is outside of the known range.

- **Number CM Ping Unreachable**: Calculated. The number of associated CMs that are reporting the ping status "Unreachable".

- **Percentage CM Ping Unreachable**: Calculated. The percentage of associated CMs that are reporting the ping status "Unreachable".

- **Percentage Utilization**: Calculated. The average utilization of all associated DS channels.

- **Average Latency**: Calculated. The average latency for all associated CMs. Only reachable CMs via ping count towards this KPI.

- **Average Jitter**: Calculated. The average jitter for all associated CMs. Only reachable CMs via ping count towards this KPI.

- **Average Packet Loss Rate**: Calculated. The average packet loss rate for all associated CMs. Only reachable CMs via ping count towards this KPI.

- **Number QAM DS Channels**: Calculated. The total number of associated Downstream channels. Calculated via aggregation.

- **Number QAM US Channels**: Calculated. The total number of associated Upstream channels. Calculated via aggregation.

- **Percentage DS Utilization**: Calculated. The average channel utilization of associated Downstream channels. Calculated via aggregation.

- **Percentage US Utilization**: Calculated. The average channel utilization of associated Upstream channels. Calculated via aggregation.
